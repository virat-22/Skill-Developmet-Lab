PROGRAM 11 – Student Management System with React.

AIM
To develop a student management system frontend using React, implementing navigation through registration, login, contact, and about pages using React Router.

DESCRIPTION
This experiment demonstrates how to build a single-page application (SPA) using React.js. The application simulates a student management system with basic navigation between multiple pages. It leverages React Router for client-side routing and component-based architecture for modular design. This project is ideal for beginners to understand the fundamentals of React, routing, JSX, component communication, and styling with CSS.
